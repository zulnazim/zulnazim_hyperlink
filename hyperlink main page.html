 <justify><p><font color="black"> My name is Muhammad Zul Nazim bin Mazlan. I am a student at Universiti Teknologi Mara, Kampus Rembau, Negeri Sembilan. Everyone can agree that I am a good person and that I like to help people in need. My favorite subjects are web programming and PC maintenance. I am going to be the best employee when i get the job because my goal is to study these subjects in further and to become a respected professional in one of the fields.</font></p></justify>

 <justify><p><font color="black"> Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. I have met a lot of those friends around me now on the street when doing my hobby. I'm in love with photography, so it was even more fun to do what I love doing so much. I wanted to take beautiful pictures of accidental individuals and share these pictures through emails or social media with them. I feel proud to see how happy they are looking at the photos where they are walking or sitting in the park somewhere.</font></p></justify>


<justify><p><font color="black">The objective I'm currently working for is to make this planet a better place to live by beginning with myself to make the improvements. Sure, I have had bad experiences in my life, but that's exactly what made me the way I am now: thankful, full of love, with a desire to study well, because in the future it will enable me to become a good person and have a high quality of life. I agree that day by day it reflects and I feel much more responsible for what I do and where I go. </font></p></justify>
